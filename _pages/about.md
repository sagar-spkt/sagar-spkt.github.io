Hello! Welcome to my small blogging website. I'm Sagar, a Machine Learning Engineer based in Nepal. Since 2018, I've driven myself into the realm of Machine Learning. I like creating computational intelligence, with a focus on Natural Language Processing, that helps both people and machines comprehend the nuances of language. To date, I've worked on remarkably influential projects: mimicking voice, assisting social emotional growth of child using conversational agent, extracting valuable details from meeting minutes, categorizing web content for maximixing relevancy of advertisements, to name a few.

My depth-first rather than breadth-first disposition causes me to ponder about a topic for a very long time until I've utter comprehension. I think this nature matches with my given name, Sagar, which translates to Ocean in English. That's why I recommend you be cautious when you see me in front of my laptop and Mr.Grumpy; storm might surge into you from the ocean.

|Mr. Grumpy is on the watch-btw, he carries my bumpy speaker.|

When I'm free, or I need to calm, I listen to music. There isn't a certain genre; I enjoy all music. In my spare time, I enjoy watching movies, playing with pets (I welcome any animal into my home), and occasionally taking little nighttime strolls.

In this technical blog, you'll find insights I gained while exploring anything(Only if I don't become lazy.ðŸ˜‰)
