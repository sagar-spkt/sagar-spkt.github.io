Hello! Welcome to my small blogging website. Iâ€™m Sagar, Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Central Florida. I'm interested in making AI socially aware. Since 2018, I've driven myself into the realm of AI and Machine Learning. I like creating computational intelligence that helps people and machines comprehend the nuances of human psychology, languages and data. Over the years, Iâ€™ve led and contributed to impactful projects: developing large-scale ad-targeting and content analysis pipelines, designing empathetic chatbots that assist childrenâ€™s socio-emotional learning, and fine-tuning speech recognition and voice cloning systems for low-resource languages.


My depth-first rather than breadth-first disposition makes me linger on a problem until I truly understand it. This nature fits my name, Sagar, which translates to Ocean in English. So, when you see me in front of my laptop and Mr. Grumpy, be cautious â€” a storm ðŸŒª might surge from the ocean.

|Mr Grumpy is on the watch; btw, he carries my bumpy speaker.|

When I'm free, or I need to calm, I listen to music. There isn't a certain genre; I enjoy all music. In my spare time, I enjoy watching movies, playing with pets (I welcome any animal into my home), and taking little nighttime strolls.

In this technical blog, you'll find insights I gained while exploring anything(Only if I don't become lazy.ðŸ˜‰)
