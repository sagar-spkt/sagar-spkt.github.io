Hello! Welcome to my small blogging website. I'm Sagar, a Machine Learning Engineer based in Nepal. Since 2018, I've driven myself into the realm of Machine Learning. I like creating computational intelligence that helps people and machines comprehend the nuances of human languages and data. To date, I've worked on remarkably influential projects: mimicking voice, assisting children's social-emotional growth using conversational agents, extracting valuable details from meeting minutes, and categorizing web content to maximize the relevancy of advertisements, lookalike modeling, to name a few.

My depth-first rather than breadth-first disposition causes me to ponder about a topic for a long time until I understood. This nature matches my given name, Sagar, which translates to Ocean in English. That's why I recommend you be cautious when you see me in front of my laptop and Mr Grumpy; a storm ðŸŒª might surge into you from the ocean.

|Mr Grumpy is on the watch; btw, he carries my bumpy speaker.|

When I'm free, or I need to calm, I listen to music. There isn't a certain genre; I enjoy all music. In my spare time, I enjoy watching movies, playing with pets (I welcome any animal into my home), and taking little nighttime strolls.

In this technical blog, you'll find insights I gained while exploring anything(Only if I don't become lazy.ðŸ˜‰)
